Assignment 6 Comments:
Looking forward to presenting our final presentations tomorrow on brute
forcing a webpage using a tool on kali called Hydra. I'm hoping I have succesfully met
the credentials for my discrete mathematics course in order to further advance my studies
in Computer Science here at WCSU. I dread the idea of a late submission, therefore I hope
this submission is acceptable. Thank you for understanding.
